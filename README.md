# NativeMap

This project is dedicated to increasing visibility of Native American land in the state of Washington.  

My goal for the project is to create a Google Maps extention or feature that creates a pop-up whenever a user selects a place that once was, or currently is, Native land.  With the initial commit, I introduced an R file that puts together the data that will be used.  For the time being, the data just includes cities that are directly named after Native tribes, including the latitude and longitude of the city, the tribe associated, and a short description of how the city was named.  In the future, I would like to add the ability to learn more about each tribe, adding links to other websites, audio files, and blurbs about the individual culture.
